            <p id="title-post">Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after drawn into the Ten Rings organization - the same terror group who's behind Tony Stark's kidnapping in Iron Man. In the comics, Shang-Chi is a master of kung-fu, similarly growing up as the heir to the 10 Rings. His father, Fu Manchu, is regarded as a problematic portrayal of xenophobic tropes, so the MCU is adjusting Shang-Chi's origins so that the longtime Iron Man villain, the Mandarin, is his father instead. Even though he often works alone, Shang-Chi goes on to fight alongside Captain America, Daredevil, and the X-Men.</p>

                <p class="comments">In the end, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings comes across as more cookie-cutter and generic because I have seen better Asian films. It's a competent film, but don't expect anything more than a Marvel blockbuster.</p>

                <p class="comments">Flits between offering up a lively picture that strives to carve out its own space in the series, and simply serving up more of the usual Marvel template but in enticing packaging.</p>

                <p class="comments">This is a terrific, entry-level work that delivers on far more visceral action than we're used to from these films.</p>
