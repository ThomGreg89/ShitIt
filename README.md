## Progress Check / Stand Up
Each week, I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by including a **Stand-Up**. A "stand-up" is when I take the time to briefly report out on the following...

1. **Accomplishments** - Successfully created login page

2. **Challenges** - Hard time getting back on track. I got sick during the week and had to hard time focusing on school.

3. **Next Steps** - Continue using knowledge from class on future assignments.

**Week 1**: This week I achieved working with terminal with the commands, setting up GitHub and creating my issues and project folder. The main challenge was the setup of ther terminal and getting the correct commands in. I will be focused on relearning some of the JavaScript as it has been a while now. I know that it's something that we will be using this month so I need to get some of that knowledge back.

**Week 2**: This week I got more comfortable using Terminals. It seems like I'm use to it. The challenge was falling behind on my assignment due to a family emergency and having to get caught up with everything. I focused all my spare time getting back on track. First making sure to  understand the material and then completing it. Second challenge was the prototype. I did not yet get a hang of using it but I'm still trying to figure it out.

**Week 3**:    This week I was able to get use to ARIA. Still learning the syntax but the easier one so far has been adding alt to images. The challenge is currently understanding setting up the login page. It is the most complicated part and that is what I will be focusing on for the final week.

**Week 4**:  This week I successfully created my login page. I was able to also complete the user page with no issues. All changes needed was also done. The main challenge was falling behind in class since I was sick and could not focus on doing anything. I spent the entire weekend getting caught up and was able to do so. My next steps after this is to complete Showcase assignment. I plan to use everything I learned from this class to enhance my knowlege of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript and carry it on to future classes. I will continue working on challenges provided too.
