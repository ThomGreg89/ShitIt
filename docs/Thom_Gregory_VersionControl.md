## PROJECT AND PORTFOLIO 1: WEB DEVELOPMENT 

* **Version Control & Workflow**
* **Gregory Thom**
* **09/02/2021**

This paper addresses some of the topic matter covered in research and activity this week. Be sure to include reference links below to the research and information you used to complete this assignment.

## Topic: Terminal
Professional developers use Terminal daily. It's essential to understand some fundamental commands to use the application. 

Update the information below to demonstrate your knowledge on this topic.   

**1. Using Terminal, there are essential commands to know.**

List the correct Terminal commands to do the actions listed below. Replace **CMD** with the correct command sequence. You can keep or enhance the brief description. 

**The last bullet provides an example**.

* clear: Clear the Screen 
* pwd: Print the "Working Directory"
* ls: List files and folders
* ls -a: List files and folders, including invisible files
* ls -lh: List all files and folders, in human readable form
* cd: Change directory
* cd /: Change directory, go to root directory
* cd ~: Change directory and go to user home directory
* cd .. : Change directory, go up one folder level
* cd ../.. : Change directory, go up two folder levels
* **cd ~/Desktop/**: Change directory to my desktop! 


**2. Using Terminal...**

**Folder Drop:** Try typing "cd" followed by a space, and then drag a folder into terminal and press return. Test this out and describe your results below.  

This will change directory to the folder that was dragged over.


## Topic: Version Control & Git
Version control, also known as revision control, records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. In this class, we are learning Git. Update the information below where indicated.  

**1. There are three types of version control.**

Local, Centralized (CVCS), and Distributed (DVCS)



**2. Using Terminal, there are also essential Git commands to know.**

List the correct Git commands to do the actions listed below in Terminal. Replace CMD with the correct command and keep or enhance the brief description. **The last bullet provides an example**. 

* git clone [url]: Clone a repository
* git config --global user.name "[firstname lastname]": Set-up a global user name
* git config --global user.email "[valid-email]": Set-up a global email address (to match my GitHub account eMail)
* git status : show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit
* git add [file]: Add modified files to the next commit
* git commit -m "[descriptive message]": Make a commit with a new message
* git log: Show my commit history
* **git help**: This command will bring up Git's help screen in Terminal!
    



**3. Connecting to GitHub using Terminal.**
HTTPS is the the correct way to connect to GitHub in this course. Describe how you connect to GitHub from Terminal using this protocol. What steps do you take? 

I would first change the directory in the terminal to where I want to put the file. Then go on Github website, click on code, and copy the link for HTTPS. In terminal, type git clone followed by the link that was copied and enter.



**4. Using .gitignore and Why it's Important**  
Most repositories contain a .gitignore file. 

* What is the purpose of this file?  
* What is the "**.DS_Store**" file and why would you want to ignore it?
* What other file or folder would you want to add to a .gitignore file and why? 


* .gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository. gitignore is located in the root of your rep.
*  .DS_Store is an invisible file on the macOS operating system that gets automatically created anytime you look into a folder whith 'Finder.' You would ignore this because you have to take precautions with your automated deployment process. If not, you could be putting these files on the server where your site or applications lives unconsciouly.
*  You can add the file that is not used by your project, the file not used by anyone else in your team, and the file that is genarated by other process.
